Keep Your Eyes Peeled
Come what come may
Birds of a Feather Flock Together
Fight Fire With Fire
Raining Cats and Dogs
A Fool and His Money Are Soon Parted
Break The Ice
Jack of All Trades Master of None
Know the Ropes
Back to Square One
Wild Goose Chase
Short End of the Stick
Barking Up The Wrong Tree
Down To The Wire
Close But No Cigar
Not the Sharpest Tool in the Shed
Fit as a Fiddle
What Goes Up Must Come Down
A Busy Bee
Down To Earth
Between a Rock and a Hard Place
Man of Few Words
Dropping Like Flies
Down For The Count
